Based on the text, here are two exercises to practice creating and enhancing a microservice with FastAPI.

**Exercise 1: Recreate and Experiment with a "Hello World" Microservice**
*   **Task:** Rebuild the "Hello World" microservice from the previous lecture.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Ensure FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed.
    2.  Create the module and run it as a microservice.
    3.  Test it in your browser.
    4.  Experiment by changing the endpoint name (e.g., try just `/`).
    5.  Observe the server's output in the terminal for each request.

**Exercise 2: Enhance the Service with an Invocation Counter**
*   **Task:** Add a feature to count how many times the "Say Hello" endpoint has been used.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Add a global counter variable to your service.
    2.  Create a new method (e.g., `get_count`) that returns the current count.
    3.  Create a new endpoint (e.g., `/get_count`) for this method so a client can retrieve the count.
    4.  Test it by calling the "Hello" endpoint several times in your browser and then checking the count.
